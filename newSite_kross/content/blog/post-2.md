My research interests are in a few different areas. First, I think it would be very interesting to work with blockchain and its implications for the financial industry. Second, I would like to work with machine learning and the implications it has for making CPUs for video games, such as Pokemon. Lastly, working with genome sequencing or any other bioinformatics based research project would be a lot of fun.
